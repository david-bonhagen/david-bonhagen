## ðŸŒŸ About Me

I'm passionate about crafting dynamic, user-friendly web applications and diving into innovative technologies. Whether it's building a high-performance website or generating AI-driven creative content, I thrive on solving challenges and learning new skills. My focus is slightly on the frontend side on things, but I enjoy tempering with backends / servers / APIs as well.


ðŸ’¼ For work, I contribute to exciting projects at [FULLHAUS GmbH](https://www.fullhaus.de).<br>
ðŸ”¬ For research, I am currently exploring the possibilities and boundaries of generative AI in media production.
